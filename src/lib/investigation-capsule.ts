/* Reproducible Investigation Capsule — pure builder.
 *
 * A capsule is a portable, structured evidence package for one published
 * study: geometry, source identifiers, processing version, configuration,
 * quality report, derived outputs, reference evidence, checksums, validation
 * status, and limitations — as JSON a reader can download, archive, and
 * re-check without the website.
 *
 * Honesty rules, enforced by the builder and pinned by tests:
 * - Nothing is promised that the package cannot do. Re-deriving a result
 *   needs the source granules (NASA Earthdata authentication) and the
 *   pipeline version named in the capsule; the capsule itself only proves
 *   the published artifacts are what they claim to be.
 * - A missing section is listed as missing, never filled with a placeholder.
 * - Validation status is copied from the study's own assessment, never upgraded.
